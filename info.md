# Law of Iterated Logarithm

## Theorem

#### Let ${X_n}$ be independent and identically distributed random variable with mean zero and variance one. Let $S_n = X_1 + ... + X_n$. Then 

$$
\limsup_{n\to{\infty}}\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} = \sqrt{2}~~~ \text{a.s.}
$$

$$
\liminf_{n\to{\infty}}\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} = -\sqrt{2}~~~ \text{a.s.}, 
$$

#### Therefore, $\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}}$ oscillates between Â±$\sqrt{2}$. 


## Connection with CLT and LLN

### Central limit theorem 
#### Let ${X_n}$ be independent and identically distributed random variable with mean zero and variance one. Let $S_n = X_1 + ... + X_n$. Then 
$$
\lim_{n\to{\infty}}\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n}} \to N(0,1)
$$

### Strong Law of Large Number 
#### Let ${X_n}$ be independent and identically distributed random variable with mean zero and variance one. Let $S_n = X_1 + ... + X_n$. Then 
$$
\lim_{n\to{\infty}}\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n}}\to~~~0 ~~~\text{a.s.}, 
$$



#### So in some sense $S_n/n$ "squeezes" down to one point whereas $S_n/\sqrt{n}$ "spreads out", roughly between -3 and 3, and $S_n/\sqrt{n}$ is a continous distirbution. 

#### It is a reasonable question then whether there is an in-between case, namely a sequence ${a_n}$ such that $\sqrt{n}$<$a_n$<$n$ converges to something between a constant and a distribution. The answer is given by the law of iterated logrithm
